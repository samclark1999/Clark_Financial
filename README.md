# Clark_Financial
This is a banking application made with standalone React and Bootstrap Styling.

## Description:
This banking app can create a user that can deposit, withdraw and check balance of all user transactions. I chose to use standalone React and Bootstrap in my HTML file and plan to convert to a full React App.

## How to Run
First clone the Clark_Financial Repo. Next you will run an npm Install and then npx http-server to spin up a local server. Finally navigate to the localhost port
